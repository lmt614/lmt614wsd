        <h2 id="bio">Meet Jessica</h2>
        <p>Eleven year old Jessica Anselmi is an aspiring fashion designer who also has a growing passion for photography. Jessica has been behind the camera since she was only nine. Her sister has a camera and her father's current job status is that of a videographer/photographer, so it stood to reason that with his mentoring, she would learn to capture good pictures. What she didn't realize is that she wold love it as much as she does.</p>
		<p>Jessica is currently attending school and gaining experience in photography by photographing family events, church functions, various landscapes and nature scenes.
Though her main goal is to become a fashion designer, Jessica's talent and love for photography is clearly displayed in these few snapshots. There is a very real possibility that she'll merge the two and become a fashion photographer.</p>
