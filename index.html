        <h2 id="bio">Meet Jessica</h2>
        <p>Eleven year old Jessica Anselmi is an aspiring fashion designer who also has a growing passion for photography. Jessica has been behind the camera since she was only nine. Her sister has a camera and her father's current job status is that of a videographer/photographer, so it stood to reason that with his mentoring, she would learn to capture good pictures. What she didn't realize is that she wold love it as much as she does.</p>
		<p>Jessica is currently attending school and gaining experience in photography by photographing family events, church functions, various landscapes and nature scenes.
Though her main goal is to become a fashion designer, Jessica's talent and love for photography is clearly displayed in these few snapshots. There is a very real possibility that she'll merge the two and become a fashion photographer.</p>

	<h2> Personal Note</h2>	
	<div id="personal_note">
		<p>When I think of a new design, I can't explain where the ideas come from. They usually come to me when I'm sleeping and I have to wake up and jot it down before I forget. Other times objects will trigger an idea. I love bling and I really enjoy going into my closet and creating numerous outfits from things I already have.</p>  

		<p>There is no right and wrong when it comes to creatively coming up with a design. A designer see's something in everything, from colors to patterns, to even a personality. Sometimes I'll see somebody and I just want to say, "Hey! You need some style!" and give them a whole new look.</p> 

		<p>Designers gather ideas from landscapes, paintings, sculptures and even buildings. There's endless possibilities to find ideas for designs. Putting it all together with hopes of a new hot trend.</p>

		<p>Photography does the same. I love to put clothes together and then try to capture my ideas in a creative composition. Moods and lighting are used to express the feelings you want in photos. I've had times where I'd see just the right image in just the right lighting and have to go and get my camera in hopes of capturing exactly what my eye was seeing. If I'm lucky I might even get an outfit designed that was inspired by that picture!</p>

<p>The world would be a dull place, were there no creative designers. Fashion is no easy road. One must be ready to face adversary, headaches, and blocks. It takes determination and an open mind. Ready for any challenge...and I'm ready!!</p>
